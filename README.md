# Unit 19 React Homework: Employee Directory

## Overview

This is an employee directory built using React and the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/) API. The application's UI is broken into components, which sre being used to manage component state, and respond to user events.

## User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

## Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.


The user should be able to:

  * Sort the table by at least one category

  * Filter the users by at least one property.
